# Fliper-2

This sketch uses an Arduino Pro Micro and makes it MIDI clas compliant MIDI controller. 

I built this controller so I could have a launchpad, but also a couple potentiometers to control parameters in my DAW.
I used all the inputs of the Arduino Pro Micro, and made it plug and play - no other software or driver needed, using the MIDIUSB library.
